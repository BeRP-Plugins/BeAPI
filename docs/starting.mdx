## Overview
BeAPI (an abbreviation for "Bedrock edition API") is a tool that aims for a faster and more reliable
development experience when working with Minecraft Bedrock edition gametests. We achieve these goals
by putting together some of the most brilliant minds in the Minecraft Bedrock developer community to
scheme up alternative ways to utilize the gametest framework so it's easier for you!

### How It Works
BeAPI uses NPM's cli create app feature to provide you with a setup to scaffold your projects. This
allows for a clean working environment separated from the core codebase. We also provide a cli for
building and bundling your packs.

## Scaffolding Your First Project

:::info Version

BeAPI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version >= 12.0.0.

For best support it is recommended you install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/).

:::

### Preparation

To scaffold your first project you will need to navigate to your Minecraft `development_behavior_packs`
folder. You can get to this folder by pressing `Win + R` and pasting this:

```
%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs
```

You will then need to open a terminal in this directory to proceed to the next step!

### Installing

When creating BeAPI our main concern was simplicity for our end users when attempting to use our package.
After some scheming, we ultimately decided NPM modules would be the best route.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      npm init beapi@latest
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      yarn create beapi@latest
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      pnpm create beapi@latest
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Building
Minecraft's gametest module linker is not the best thing known to mankind. To make everything function
correctly you'll need to build the project every time you make a change so BeAPI can transpile its core
module into your code.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      npm run build
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      yarn run build
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      pnpm run build
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Bundling
Once you feel you've finished your package and you're ready to prepare it for production and distribution
you may want to bundle it into a `.mcpack` first.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      npm run bundle
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      yarn run bundle
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
      pnpm run bundle
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### How Do I Tell The Bundler To Include More Files?
We realized when making Minecraft packs; users may want to add more files to the final pack.
So we made the bundler parse a property in your package called `include`. The bundler will
recognize and recursively add any files or folders to the final bundled package.

This field should look like so:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "include": [
    "scripts",
    "manifest.json",
    "animation_controllers",
    "entities",
    "pack_icon.png"
  ]
}
```
