First off, welcome to BeAPI's first release üéâ
Thank you for sticking with us and helping us
contemplate ideas for this package. It sure
has been an intriguing journey up to this point.

Now with that aside...

<!-- truncate -->

It's 3:45 in the morning, and I just finished
writing all the docs out for this bad boy
*after procrastinating and playing Walkabout Mini Golf with some friends.*

Let me say; Writing documentation truly makes
you contemplate life: "why am I here?",
"How did I get here?", "Can I go to bed now?".
BUT NO... I feel like a freaking world war translator
decrypting massive files of gibberish written by my
peers with no help.

I was ultimately planning on removing the blogs page from
this website. My mindset at the time was something along the
lines of: "You've got me \*\*\*\*\*\* up if you think I am going to
write more words!"

BUT After briefly reconsidering, I figured maybe posting here
would be fun, thus my resolve to write this.

Anyways, even though BeAPI is released to the public fully now,
I do want to warn, we are going to violate semver a bit. We
made some changes to the beta branch we meant to push to production,
but we got ahead of ourselves accidentally and made a release.

I'll probably end up just throwing changes like that in a migration
guide or something when I decide to add version management to the docs.

I suppose that is all I have for this first post. I apologize if it's
a bit bland, but you should probably cut me some slack; It's now 4:00 in
the morning, and my brain is deep-fried.

Once again, thank you very much all for the continued
support we love ya ‚ù§Ô∏è *no homo... or maybe not?* üò≥
