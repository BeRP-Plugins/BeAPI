It sure\\r\\nhas been an intriguing journey up to this point.\\r\\n\\r\\n![BeAPI Logo](./beapi.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow with that aside...\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s 3:45 in the morning, and I just finished\\r\\nwriting all the docs out for this bad boy\\r\\n*after procrastinating and playing Walkabout Mini Golf with some friends.*\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me say; Writing documentation truly makes\\r\\nyou contemplate life: \\"why am I here?\\",\\r\\n\\"How did I get here?\\", \\"Can I go to bed now?\\".\\r\\nBUT NO... I feel like a freaking world war translator\\r\\ndecrypting massive files of gibberish written by my\\r\\npeers with no help.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ultimately planning on removing the blogs page from\\r\\nthis website. My mindset at the time was something along the\\r\\nlines of: \\"You\'ve got me \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* up if you think I am going to\\r\\nwrite more words!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT After briefly reconsidering, I figured maybe posting here\\r\\nwould be fun, thus my resolve to write this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyways, even though BeAPI is released to the public fully now,\\r\\nI do want to warn, we are going to violate semver a bit. We\\r\\nmade some changes to the beta branch we meant to push to production,\\r\\nbut we got ahead of ourselves accidentally and made a release.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll probably end up just throwing changes like that in a migration\\r\\nguide or something when I decide to add version management to the docs.\\r\\n\\r\\n_\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose that is all I have for this first post. I apologize if it\'s\\r\\na bit bland, but you should probably cut me some slack; It\'s now 4:00 in\\r\\nthe morning, and my brain is deep-fried.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, thank you very much all for the continued\\r\\nsupport we love ya \u2764\ufe0f *no homo... or maybe not?* \ud83d\ude33"}]}')}}]);
