# BeAPI

GameTest FrameWork is a great and amazing new feature in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This gives you the ability to script and do much more! BeAPI essentially is an api warpper for the "mojang-minecraft" module of the GameTest Framework. BeAPI adds more useful methods to this framework.

Still in development.
